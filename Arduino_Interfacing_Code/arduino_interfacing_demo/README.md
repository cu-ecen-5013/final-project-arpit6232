The following source code is in accordance with the [Tiny Machine Learning Kit](https://github.com/AESD-Course-Project/AESD-Course-Project.github.io/blob/gh-pages/src/TinyML.md).

This code is ported and modified from model development from [tensorflow v1.0 to v2.0](https://github.com/AESD-Course-Project/AESD-Course-Project.github.io/issues/3) and  includes a modified verison of the 0.0.2 version of the [OV767X Library for Arduino](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_OV767X) which is based on https://www.kernel.org[Linux Kernel's] V4L2 driver for OmniVision OV7670 cameras - which was created by Jonathan Corbet.
