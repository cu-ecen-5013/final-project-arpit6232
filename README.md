# ECEN 5713 Final Project Repository 

### Repository Owner - Arpit Savarkar 

This Repository Contains the Tensorflow Code for Deploying Tiny Machine learning over Jetson Nano and Arduino BLE 33 to react to a camera feed to detect to a person. 

## Repository Overview 
- [Final Project Overview Wiki Page](https://github.com/AESD-Course-Project/AESD-Course-Project.github.io/wiki/Project-Overview)

## Sprint 1 

### Code
1. Port Tensorflow code : https://github.com/arpit6232/visualwakeup_aesd
2. Create Arduino Library : https://github.com/arpit6232/arduino-library

### Documentation
1. [Arduino Interface for Jetson](docs/arduino_setup.md)
2. [Jetson Setup for Jetson Nano](install_jetson_yocto.md)

### Comments 
Currently this repository should hold all the independent goals are separate repositories as much of the code is based on development version of other libraries. And involves testing and development. 

Specifically : https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/issues/1254#issuecomment-813161941
